### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 was fun because I got to create a functioning spellcheck that would work if I used it on any one of my papers I wrote.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was cool because it involved nesting for loops which really kicked my brain into overdrive to understand how the program would work and ended up being a fun challenge.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was one of my favorites because I was able to make a functioning blackjack game, the code had a lot of functions that I had to write so it was a bit of a challenge but it was very enjoyable.
